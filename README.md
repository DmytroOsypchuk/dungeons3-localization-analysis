# Game Localization Data Analysis

## Overview
This project is a **data analysis case study** based on the localization file of the video game **Dungeons 3**.  
The main objective was to explore, structure, and visualize the contents of a large localization dataset in order to support the fan-driven Ukrainian localization project.  

The analysis demonstrates how **data-driven approaches** can improve the efficiency of software localization workflows, especially when dealing with large volumes of text and multiple collaborators.  

ðŸ‘‰ The final localization result can be found on Steam: [Ukrainian Localization for Dungeons 3](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3522560800)

## Project Background
The idea for this analysis emerged during a real localization project.  
The gameâ€™s localization was stored in a single file containing:
- **8182 Translation Units (TUs)** â€” indivisible text segments (words, phrases, sentences, or sets of sentences).
- **115985 words** across all translation units.  

Since all in-game text was contained in a single file, which made translation management challenging. To make the process more structured, the text was:
- **Classified and split into 24 thematic files** (system messages, UI elements, dialogues, storylines, etc.).
- **Analyzed by size** â€” both in terms of translation units and word counts.
- **Analyzed by tags** â€” counted and quantified each tag applied to translation units, providing insights into their distribution and usage.
- **Mapped to characters** â€” calculating the number of dialogue lines per character, as well as per mission.  

This provided not only a more efficient workflow for translators but also valuable insights for potential **voice-over planning** and team workload distribution.

## Results
The analysis led to:
- **24 text categories** with clear thematic boundaries.  
- **Detailed word & TU statistics** for each category.
- **Tag distribution analysis** â€” counted and visualized the frequency of each tag across translation units.  
- **Character dialogue distribution** per mission.  
- **Data visualizations** created in Tableau for quick insights.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Google Sheets** â€“ for cleaning, classification, and notes.  
- **Tableau** â€“ for visualization and exploration of key insights.  

*(Detailed workflow with Google Sheets will be described in [`/docs/workflow.md`].)*

## Usage
To explore the analysis:
1. Open `/data` for cleaned datasets in `.csv` and `.xlsx` formats.  
2. View visualizations in `/images` or open Tableau dashboards from `/dashboards`.

## Key Takeaways
This project illustrates how **data analysis can enhance the localization process** by:
- Transforming unstructured game files into meaningful datasets.  
- Enabling team-based workflows through structured text segmentation.  
- Providing statistical and visual insights for translation and dubbing tasks.  

It can serve both as:
- A **portfolio project** showcasing practical data analysis skills.  
- A **real-world case study** of applying data analytics in **software localization**.
