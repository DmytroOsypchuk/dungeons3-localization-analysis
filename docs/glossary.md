# Glossary: Game Localization Data Analysis

### Translation Unit (TU)  
The smallest indivisible segment of translatable text, which may consist of a word, a phrase, a sentence, or a set of sentences, and is used as the basic unit in localization workflows.

### Localization File  
The extracted source file containing all in-game text (UI strings, dialogues, system messages, etc.), usually structured in key-value pairs.  

### Text Category  
A classification label assigned to translation units according to their functional or narrative role (e.g., UI elements, quests, dialogues, system messages).  

### Tag  
A metadata marker attached to some translation units (e.g., placeholders, gameplay triggers, conditions).

### UID (Unique Identifier)  
A unique key or reference used to identify each translation unit within the game files, ensuring accurate mapping.  

### Character Distribution  
The quantitative breakdown of translation units and word counts per character, often analyzed to assess workload balance and voice-over requirements.  

### Mission Distribution  
The allocation of translation units and word counts across missions or events, useful for planning translation effort and narrative flow.  

### Content Classification  
The process of assigning translation units into predefined content groups to improve translator workflow and project management.  

### Workload Estimation  
The calculation of translation and voice-over volumes (by category, character, or mission) to support project planning and resource allocation.  

### Domain-Specific Analysis  
A data-driven approach tailored to a specific industry or field â€” in this case, the video game localization process.
