dlg_general_idle_v82,"One of your Little Snots invented the wheel and claims that carts can increase efficiency in the Dungeon by 100%! That may be the case, but it's way more fun to watch them drag their butts carrying stuff, ha ha ha!",7670,1,

spells_MagicBarrier_function,"This Spell can give a little respite from somewhat too obtrusive Heroes. The Spell acts on a free undeveloped Tile in the Dungeon. There a barrier of writhing demonic Tentacles appears, which remains impenetrable to all creatures as long as it still has Hit Points. The Magic Barrier can be attacked by all enemies and destroyed. Otherwise, it automatically disappears at the end of its normal duration.

Sure, a couple of hearty Slaps from the Hand of Terror “motivate” your Little Snots and creatures, but somehow that’s just not the idea! Luckily, there’s this Spell that increases a Rooms efficiency! Oh, of course, there’s no reason you can’t combine it with a few motivating Slaps!

The Spell is cast on a free Gallery Tile, from which a huge Tentacle then emerges to attack all enemy units on the surrounding Tiles.

The Tentacle can and will be attacked by enemies. Once its Life Energy has been used up, the Tentacle disappears again. Otherwise, it will disappear at the end of the Spell's duration.",5147,,

spells_SummonSquads_function,"Skeletons and Zombies are pretty cool creatures, espeically because you can have so many of them! Unfortunately, getting them is a little tiresome, what with having to kill Heroes and so on. This Spell can make the whole process MUCH easier!

This Spell conjures some simple Undead creatures such as Skeletons and Zombies in the area of effect, who then fight for you. In contrast to their “normal” counterparts – the ones you got by “processing” Heroes – the creatures conjured by the Spell only last for its duration before disintegrating into their individual parts.",6895,,
